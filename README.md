# Numerical Simulation of Convective-Diffusive Heat Transport by an Incompressible Viscous Flow

In this work we present a numerical study of heat transport through a moving fluid, in which convection and diffusion processes are considered. The transport is carried out by a newtonian, laminar, irrotational, incompressible and transient flow of a fluid based on the Navier-Stokes equations and the Convection-Diffusion equation. This study provides a basis for more theoretical investigations involving stability, existence of weak solutions and extensions to newtonian fluids.

## Square Cavity
### Domain
Square cavity with velocity boundary condition Γ_1 = (1,0) on the top (lid) of the cavity, and Γ_2 = (0,0) on the rest of the walls.
